## v04

Took the decision to drop the idea to use OpenCV 3.0 on the Raspiberry Pi itself. It should serve as image provicer due to it's low performance. Image processing shall be computed by SOMETHING else. [This decision may be revised]
Next step is to set up raspicam correctly and get it going.

This is devastating :(

Simon says: Make face recognition with the attached 3,5" Display as output.
And log recognized person appearance.
