***Date: 16.06.'17*** Motion

Found
[Motion with Raspicam [v4l2 - german]](https://www.bitblokes.de/2014/01/kameramodul-des-raspberry-pi-v4l-treiber-video4linux-und-motion/)
so I can use Motion with the Raspiberry Pi now.

Config in:
> /etc/motion/motion.conf

Finally got OpenCV working with raspicam library [like 5 years work ...]
Now the true work begins!

got someOpenCV code compiling. Though cannot find the right video stream.
installing a newer version of raspicam.
found a old and compiled (unfortunately i have no clue HOW it was compiled) raspicam_cv_test. so i CAN work somehow!

Took the decision to drop the idea to use OpenCV 3.0 on the Raspiberry Pi itself. It should serve as image provicer due to it's low performance. Image processing shall be computed by SOMETHING else. [This decision may be revised]
Next step is to set up raspicam correctly and get it going.

where do I put new messages? Or where do I store outdated ones?

Simon says: Make face recognition with the attached 3,5" Display as output.
And log recognized person appearance.

This becomes my git project to lean computer vision with OpenCV 3.2.0 in C++ (due to it's performance) and practice github.
And a bit markdown for Documentation.
